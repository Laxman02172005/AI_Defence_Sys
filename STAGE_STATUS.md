# Red Team AI — Stage Status Registry

This file is the authoritative project stage-status record. Do not infer stage completion from code, tests, or model artifacts. A stage is COMPLETED only when its stage report/acceptance gate has explicitly declared completion and this file has been updated.

## Stage Dependency Map

### Core project

Stage 1
→ Stage 2
→ Stage 3
→ Stage 4

### IEEE-CIS experimental/learning track

IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5A
→ IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5B
→ IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5C
→ IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5D
→ IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5E
→ IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5F

### PaySim parallel/context track

PaySim Stage 4.5A

PaySim Stage 4.5A is a PARALLEL / CONTEXT track.

It informs the overall dataset/objective decision.

It is NOT a prerequisite for IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5E.

The dependency graph MUST NOT show:

IEEE-CIS 4.5D
→ PaySim 4.5A
→ IEEE-CIS 4.5E

That dependency is incorrect.

## Status Integrity Rules

Do NOT infer completion from:

- source code existing
- tests passing
- model artifacts existing
- commits existing
- a later stage having been implemented
- good ML metrics

A stage may be marked COMPLETED only when:

1. Its acceptance criteria have passed.
2. Its required tests have passed.
3. Its stage report explicitly declares completion.
4. STAGE_STATUS.md is updated as part of the official stage-completion commit.

PRELIMINARY != COMPLETED

NOT STARTED != COMPLETED

BLOCKED != COMPLETED

NEEDS RECONSTRUCTION != COMPLETED

Never retroactively upgrade a stage to justify downstream work.

## Evidence Rule

Every stage entry MUST contain a checkable evidence reference.

`HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION` alone is NOT sufficient.

Evidence should identify the strongest available source, such as:

- stage report title
- report section
- repository artifact path
- commit hash
- or a combination

Example:

Evidence:
`Stage 4.5D report — "STAGE 4.5D — IEEE-CIS PROXY SENSITIVITY"; historical reconstruction`

If the exact report cannot be retrieved:

Evidence:
`Historical reconstruction; exact source artifact not available`

Do NOT invent report titles, paths, or evidence.

## Mandatory Future Stage Update Procedure

Before beginning every future stage:

1. Read STAGE_STATUS.md.
2. Identify all required prerequisites.
3. Verify their statuses.
4. Report prerequisite statuses before implementation.
5. STOP if any required prerequisite is incomplete.

After completing a stage:

1. Run required tests.
2. Produce the official stage acceptance report.
3. Update STAGE_STATUS.md.
4. Record:
   - status
   - completion date
   - commit
   - scope
   - evidence
   - prerequisite(s)
   - dependency role
   - next stage
   - next stage allowed
5. Commit STAGE_STATUS.md in the same official stage-completion commit.
6. Push to origin/master.
7. STOP.

This procedure applies to ALL future stages.

### IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5E Addendum
Status: COMPLETED (CONDITIONAL)
Completed on: 2026-08-27
Commit: (Pending Review / Uncommitted)
Scope: Validate COMPOSITE_PAYMENT_CONTEXT_BEHAVIOR as a defensible fallback objective
Evidence: reports/stage_4_5E_addendum.md (Revision + Section 6 + AMBIGUOUS profiling)
Verdict: CONDITIONAL — proxy is defensible for the majority of entities,
  EXCLUDING entities matching the rule:
    device_match_rate >= 0.50 AND top3_known_device_coverage < 0.60
  This rule-based exclusion (not a size cutoff) removes 100 entities /
  30,023 rows (~5.3% of the 569,877-row legitimate corpus) confirmed as
  diffuse-gateway traffic via empirical drilldown.
  AMBIGUOUS entities (398 / 16,645 rows, ~2.9%) are RETAINED based on
  ASSUMPTION-tier structural reasoning (small-N device-usage profile
  resembling shared-but-coherent contexts), not the same empirical bar
  applied to CONFIRMED_DIFFUSE/CONFIRMED_STABLE. Flagged for revisit if
  Stage 4.5F model behavior suggests this population is problematic.
Required for Stage 4.5F: dataset construction MUST apply the exclusion
  rule above before building the supervised sequence dataset.
Prerequisite(s): IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5E
Dependency role: DOWNSTREAM
Next stage: IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5F
Next stage allowed: YES, conditional on exclusion rule being implemented

### IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5F
Status: COMPLETED
Completed on: 2026-08-27
Commit: 53e5cd1
Scope: Rebuild supervised dataset using the approved proxy/objective and retrain the corrected baseline
Evidence: reports/stage_4_5F_results.md; models/normal_behavior/logistic_regression_v2/
Result: Dataset rebuilt with Stage 4.5E Addendum exclusion rule applied
  (100 entities / 30,023 rows excluded; 539,854 rows retained). Manifest
  leakage from v1 caught and fixed (imputation stats regenerated from v2
  train split only). Corrected model: Macro F1 = 0.6790, Balanced
  Accuracy = 0.6372. Majority-class baseline for v2: 0.1810.
  NAIVE DOMAIN BASELINE ("predict previous_ProductCD"): Macro F1 = 0.7508
  — outperforms the trained model by ~0.07 F1 on identical test split.
Integration decision: DO NOT INTEGRATE. Per standing ML strategy (item 8:
  "ML performance alone must not justify a modeling decision"), the
  corrected model fails to beat a one-line domain heuristic on its own
  training/eval population, and its applicability to the Normal World's
  synthetic personas (a distinct population from IEEE-CIS proxy entities)
  was never validated. The Normal World should NOT adopt this ML
  pipeline for next-transaction-category prediction.
Prerequisite(s): IEEE-CIS Stage 4.5E Addendum
Dependency role: DOWNSTREAM
Next stage: Normal World behavior update — evaluate adopting the naive
  previous_ProductCD-persistence rule (or an equivalent domain-modeled
  persistence mechanism) in place of the current stateless
  rng.choices(["purchase","transfer"]) weighting, since it outperformed
  ML at near-zero implementation cost. This is a SEPARATE, smaller gate
  from Blue Team / LLM planner work.
Next stage allowed: YES — scoped to the Normal World persistence-rule
  evaluation above. Blue Team / LLM planner stages remain NOT unblocked
  by this closeout and require their own separate readiness review.
